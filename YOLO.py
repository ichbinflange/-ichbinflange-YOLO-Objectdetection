 - Wrapping Up the Filtering

It's time to implement a function taking the output of the deep CNN (the 19x19x5x85 dimensional encoding) and filtering through all the boxes using the functions you've just implemented. 
Implement `yolo_eval()` which takes the output of the YOLO encoding and filters the boxes using score threshold and NMS. There's just one last implementational detail you have to know. There're a few ways of representing boxes, such as via their corners or via their midpoint and height/width. YOLO converts between a few such formats at different times, using the following functions (which are provided): 

the function named below is an helper function
boxes = yolo_boxes_to_corners(box_xy, box_wh) 

which converts the yolo box coordinates (x,y,w,h) to box corners' coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) to fit the input of `yolo_filter_boxes`

YOLO's network was trained to run on 608x608 images. If you are testing this data on a different size image -- for example, the car detection dataset had 720x1280 images
 -- this step rescales the boxes so that they can be plotted on top of the original 720x1280 image.

Convert Output of the Model to Usable Bounding Box Tensors
The output of yolo_model is a (m, 19, 19, 5, 85) tensor that needs to pass through non-trivial processing and conversion. You will need to call yolo_head to format the
 encoding of the model you got from yolo_model into something decipherable:

yolo_model_outputs = yolo_model(image_data) yolo_outputs = yolo_head(yolo_model_outputs, anchors, len(class_names)) 
The variable yolo_outputs will be defined as a set of 4 tensors that you can then use as input by your yolo_eval function.
 yolo_head is implemented in the file keras_yolo.py. 
The file is also located in your workspace in this path: yad2k/models/keras_yolo.py.
